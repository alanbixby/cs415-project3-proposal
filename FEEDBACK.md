# DEMO

Not running on VM, but publically accesible plots.

API with full documentation.

started with flask; ended up using fastapi

Minimal dashboard.

API does a bunch of stuff.

Looks at sentiment over time; differentiates the sentiment time series.

Dashboard has hard coded parameters, but hits the API.

The graphs let you hide/show a particular line.

Can get back a binary image (a jpg or png or whatever) via the fastapi test documentation.
